# advanced oriented object programming class 
repo for my oop advanced class. we have done several project :
- my atoi base
- my fast scrabble
- my stack
- coin miner

_i will explain more about each project later_

I have to coin miner because i rewrite my code, it was not necessary to create so much object.
